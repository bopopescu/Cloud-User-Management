# Cloud-User-Management-System

This is the project for Cloud User Management.

I revised the horizon and zun project to customize the openstack dashboards.

Revised Horizon and Zun build process codes to deploy them in Kubernetes Clusters by Kubectl.

Customized horizon openstack dashboards front-end in Angular JS and back-end in Django Python.

Designed functions for user to create, delete, update, list and show their cloud user containers on dashboards.

Built Linux patch scripts to automatically append new customized openstack dashboards for future scalability.

Implemented user authentication system, including user login, registration, account activation and password reset.
